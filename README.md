# ffuf-outputter
A cleaner way to save my ffuf output - consider combining it with ffuf easily.

# Usage Example
First change the directory in the python file to where you are going to be running the ffuf scan. Instead of "/home/hackershiv/tools/ffuf.json", change to your working directory.

ffuf -u "https://evil.com/FUZZ" -w ~/tools/OneListForAll/onelistforallmicro.txt -o ffuf.json && python3 ~/tools/ffufoutput.py && rm -rf ffuf.json

# Why?
You can just easily click on the URL from your terminal instead of manually typing in your browser and formatted in .json which is messy to read.
